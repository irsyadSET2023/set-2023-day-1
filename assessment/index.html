      MIMOS Berhad | Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur <br />
      Research Officer | 06/2022 - 06/2023
    </h3>
    <p>
      Involved in a project called AIREM (Artificial Intelligence Residential
      Monitoring), which is being funded by MOSTI (Minister of Science and
      Technology). The aim of this project is to develop a single sensor that
      collected high frequency data (voltage and current) that can be attached
      to the main distribution box in a house, and use AI algorithms to
      disaggregate the combined signal from multiple appliances. By doing so,
      AIREM will enable homeowners to monitor their energy usage and identify
      the appliances that consume the most energy, thus helping them to save
      money on their utility bills.
